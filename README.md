# Implementations for the assignments given in CSE-167x Computer Graphics course. 

## Summary of Contents
- hw0, hw1, hw2 - openGL and GLSL (all passed with full score) 

- hw3 - openmp + raytracing from scratch (passed with full score)

## Environment 
- Macbook Air M3
- Libraries were installed through homebrew
- Hw3-scene7 took ~2.5 hrs since the implemented algorithm is not an optimized version. Other scenes took only a matter of seconds/minutes with openmp enabled.
